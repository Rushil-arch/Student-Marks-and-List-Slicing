# Student Marks and List Slicing

## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks
This Python script creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their marks are values. It asks the user to input a student's name, retrieves and displays the corresponding marks, and handles errors gracefully if the student's name is not found.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing
This Python script creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements from the list, reverses these extracted elements, and prints both the extracted list and the reversed list.

## How to Run the Scripts
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the scripts using Python:
   ```sh
   python task1_student_marks.py
   python task2_list_slicing.py
